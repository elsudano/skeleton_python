# Source code
In this directory is the source code, it is distributed in different directories to make it easier to add the code in the right place

## Controller
In the `controller` directory there is everything related to the logic of the program, so if we need to give functionality, to the different buttons and options of our program we will need to add here the different files that add that functionality.

## Model
In the `model` directory is housed everything that has to do with the data structures that we need for our program, so if we need a database or any other data structure you have to add the different control files here.

## Views
As this is a little more complex, what has been done is to separate the possible views that will have our program in several directories, so for the different desktop views to the `view_app` directory for possible Web views is the directory `view_web` in this way we can use the program with different user interfaces.
